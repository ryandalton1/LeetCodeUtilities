# LeetCodeUtilities
This is a collection of useful code that I've written or more likely have seen and hope to utilize in the future. All code that was not written by me is here purely for my own studies and will be clearly marked as code written by someone else with the appropriate credit.

"HashMap-WordLookup" was taken from a top submission to the "Add and Search Word" problem on LeetCode. There is no account linked to the submission but this code was not written by me. That being said this is a beautiful way to store strings and search for them. There are a couple oddities to the problem; one is that if you search ".ar" then aar, bar, car, dar, etc... all count as suitable words. We just need to return true or false though, not the word. Common practice for this problem would be a Trie Tree with every node being one letter and having 26 children. This implementation however uses a Hash Map with every key representing the length of the word and the value being an ArrayList of strings. So you insert "apple" that goes under the 5 key and has an arraylist that contains "apple". To search for ".pple" a helper function is written that takes two strings and compares them letter by letter then returns true or false. If one letter is '.' then they are both skipped. so if we search for ".pple" it goes to key 5, then compares ".pple" to every word in the list. Ends up having a very low runtime
